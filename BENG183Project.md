## 1.1 What is Precision Medicine? <br />
Traditional medicine caters to massive groups of people with a corresponding disease for treatment. Medical professionals consider factors such as gender and age but usually tailor treatment to the larger groups of people that have the disease. The disadvantage of this older form of treatment is that patients of the disease respond to treatments differently. This is where precision medicine comes in. 

Precision medicine is defined as an approach to disease prevention and treatment that considers differences in genetics, lifestyle, and environment among individuals. This involves the tailoring of medical decisions and treatments based on these factors for each patient. An example of this is the case in which a donor’s blood type is matched to a recipient for a blood transfusion. 

Due to the Human Genome Project, the mapping of the genes in the human body has enabled researchers to understand the genetics of various diseases and how they potentially differ amongst individuals. If a disease elucidates itself in the presence of specific genomic alterations, scientists can design therapies that target these changes to inhibit the effects.

### Introduction to Precision Oncology

One of the main applications of precision medicine is in cancer, thus eliciting the field of precision oncology. Traditional cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy, are toxic to all types of cells and can thus damage healthy cells as well as cancerous ones, leading to drastic side effects for the affected patient. Targeted therapy thus represents a type of personalized treatment utilized in precision oncology as another form of treatment that targets cancer cells with a specific genetic marker and leaves healthy cells intact. It is a more precise form of treatment that directly attacks the genetic alterations of cancer cells, and since it has this specific target, healthy cells are not considered.

### 1.2 Lung Cancer Overview and Current Treatments <br /> 

One of the cancer subtypes in which precision medicine is utilized in is lung cancer. Being the leading cause of cancer mortality, lung cancer has two types, categorized by how the cancer cells look under the microscope: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Non small cell lung cancer is considered to be around 4 times more common than small cell lung cancer.

Normally caused by smoking tobacco, SCLC typically begins in the bronchi, which are the major air passages that progressively lead into smaller structures along the lungs. Once it completely impacts the bronchi, it spreads to other vital parts of the body, especially the lymph nodes. SCLC is categorized into two subtypes: small-cell carcinoma and combined small-cell carcinoma. These subtypes are differentiated based on their look when examined under a microscope. Small-cell carcinoma looks flat-like under the microscope, while combined small-cell carcinoma involves a tumor composed of cells from small-cell carcinoma and cells from NSCLC. 

Meanwhile, NSCLC normally grows and spreads at a slower pace than SCLC, so slow that symptoms are not usually detected until it inhabits an advanced stage. The three types of NSCLC are lung adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma refers to cancer that develops in the glandular tissue and is a part of other common cancer subtypes, such as breast cancer. For NSCLC, it is located on the exterior of the lung that holds the glands which discharge mucus. Squamous cell carcinoma starts in the lung’s center and is associated with tobacco smoking, while large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma can spread quickly from any part of the lung. It is normally considered a diagnosis of exclusion, which indicates that it is determined via process of elimination. 

The current treatments for NSCLC vary by stage and the patient’s lung function. For stages 0 and 1, in which the cancer is found in the cells and the lung, surgery is used. Surgery is also used for patients with stage 2 lung cancer, but additional chemotherapy is used to eliminate the remaining cancer cells post-surgery. For patients with stage 3 lung cancer, during which it spreads into the lymph nodes, a combination of radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or surgery is applied, depending on the size of the tumor, its location, and which lymph nodes it has spread to.
And finally, for individuals with stage 4, targeted therapy is commonly utilized after testing for certain gene mutations.
 
## 1.3 Genomic Targeting of Lung Cancer <br />
As oncology has previously trended towards a molecular classification of the various cancer subtypes due to a kinase inhibitor being used in myeloid leukemia, genomic targeting for EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements in non small cell lung cancer samples adhered to the theme of personalized care in precision medicine. Lung cancer specialists conduct genetic testing to determine such molecular targets to choose the appropriate drug for the corresponding patient. Specifically, next-generation sequencing is performed to identify these genetic aberrations, and based on these results, specialists recommend or not the utilization of targeted therapy.

EGFR mutations, exemplified by the deletion of exon 19 and a point mutation of exon 21, are widely considered primary oncogenic drivers of lung cancer, particularly NSCLC. In addition, 10-15% of patients with lung cancer are EGFR-positive, meaning that they have the mutation. Due to this, therapeutic agents such as erlotinib and dasatinib have been developed to target these genomic alterations and are now the standard treatment utilized in the clinic for patients with EGFR-positive NSCLC, along with the ALK rearrangements. 

Targeted therapies are categorized based on the specific mutation they target and attack, summarized in the following table:

| Category     | Target | Drug Names |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| EGFR inhibitors    | EGFR    | Afatinib (Gilotrif), Dacomitinib (Vizimpro), Erlotinib (Tarceva), Gefitinib (Iressa), Osimertinib (Tagrisso), Amivantamab (Rybrevant), Mobocertinib (Exkivity)|
| Drugs targeting HER2 mutations  | HER2     | Fam-trastuzumabderuxtecan-nxki (Enhertu) |
| Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors  | ALK   | Alectinib (Alecensa), Brigatinib (Alunbrig), Ceritinib (Zykadia), Crizotinib (Xalkori), Lorlatinib (Lorbrena) |
| Drugs targeting ROS1 fusion   | ROS1 gene     | Ceritinib (Zykadia), Crizotinib (Xalkori),Entrectinib (Rozlytrek)|
| Drugs targeting KRAS G12C mutations  | KRAS G12C mutations      | Sotorasib (Lumakras) |
| Drugs targeting NTRK fusion  | NTRK gene fusion      | Entrectinib (Rozlytrek), Larotrectinib (Vitrakvi)|
| Drugs targeting BRAF V600E mutations  | BRAF gene      | Dabrafenib (Tafinlar), Trametinib (Mekinist)|
| Drugs targeting MET exon 14 skipping   | MET exon 14     | Capmatinib (Tabrecta), Tepotinib (Tepmetko)|
| Drugs targeting RET fusion   | RET gene fusion   | Pralsetinib (Gavreto), Selpercatinib (Retevmo)|


These targeted therapy treatments for lung cancer, called tyrosine kinase inhibitors, target the EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangements to inhibit cancer cell growth and prevent tumor growth. These genomic alterations normally lead to overexpression of the tyrosine domain in the cell membrane. 

### Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors 
Tyrosine kinases phosphorylate particular amino acids on substrate enzymes, resulting in tyrosine kinase inhibitors disrupting the signal transduction pathways that lead to uncontrolled division and growth due to these genomic alterations.

Kinase inhibitors are classified as reversible or irreversible. Reversible kinase inhibitors do not block the ATP binding site placed in the region with catalytic activity, while irreversible kinase inhibitors do while covalently binding to it. 

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are typically taken orally by medical patients, although dosing should be uniquely determined based on the genetic factors, overall health, and tolerance of the individual. 

## 1.4 Genetic Testing for Targeted Therapy <br />
The importance of genetic testing in targeted therapy cannot be understated. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled the whole genome to be sequenced, along with the entire exome. With the utilization of NGS, genomic profiles of many cancer subtypes have been elucidated, leading to the discovery of various genetic mutations that are instrumental in eliciting cancer within affected patients. These genetic mutations now serve as predictive biomarkers of these cancer subtypes that enable the development of targeted therapy treatments. <br />
Due to the EGFR and KRAS mutations being determined as oncogenic driver mutations in lung cancer, the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, described above, that target EGFR mutations has resulted in incredible advances in therapy treatment. Standard therapy treatments that target other genomic alterations are now heavily recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, an organization dedicated to advancements in oncological treatments.
